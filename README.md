This thermometer idea came to me when my little sister asked me “Vince, what’s the temperature?”. Answering I said, “Well, I’ll look it up.” So I looked it up but that wasn’t enough for her, this continued for a few days. She then wanted the humidity as well as the temperature, so I decided to build a 'meter' that she could use whenever she wanted the to see the temperature or humidity readings in real time accuracy. This is the result.
